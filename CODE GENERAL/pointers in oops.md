ðŸŽ¯ So Whatâ€™s a Pointer/Reference in OOP?

Short answer:

    In OOP languages like Java and Python, objects are not stored directly in variables â€” instead, the variable holds a reference (a.k.a. pointer) to where the object is stored in memory.

Thatâ€™s it.
ðŸ¤¯ What Does That Even Mean?

Letâ€™s say:

Car car1 = new Car();

Hereâ€™s what really happens:

    new Car() creates the object somewhere in memory (like @0xABC123)

    car1 doesn't hold the whole car â€” it holds a reference to that memory

So when you do:

Car car2 = car1;

Youâ€™re NOT creating a new car.

Youâ€™re saying:

    "Yo car2, just point to the same car that car1 points to."

Both car1 and car2 are now pointing to the same object. Change one, and the other sees it too.
ðŸ§  Analogy Time:

Imagine a house (object), and car1 is a Google Maps location saved to your phone.

When you send that location to a friend as car2, theyâ€™re not getting a new house â€” just the same map pin.

Both of you are looking at the same house.
ðŸ”¥ Proof In Code (Java)

class Car {
    String color;
}

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Car car1 = new Car();
        car1.color = "Red";

        Car car2 = car1;
        car2.color = "Blue";

        System.out.println(car1.color);  // Output: Blue
    }
}

You changed car2.color to Blue â€” and suddenly car1.color is also Blue?

Boom. Reference confirmed.
ðŸ§¬ Now In Python

class Car:
    def __init__(self, color):
        self.color = color

car1 = Car("Red")
car2 = car1
car2.color = "Blue"

print(car1.color)  # Output: Blue

Same story. Python also passes object references, not actual copies.
ðŸ”„ What If You Want a Real Copy?

You gotta do a deep copy, not just car2 = car1.

In Java, you might:

    Use a copy constructor

    Use .clone() or a manual copy function

In Python, you use:

import copy
car2 = copy.deepcopy(car1)

ðŸ’¡ Summary (Write This in Your Head)

    Variables donâ€™t hold the actual object â€” they hold a reference (pointer) to the object

    Assigning one object to another (car2 = car1) means they both point to the same thing

    Changes through one variable affect the original

    You only get separate memory if you create a new object or do a deep copy
