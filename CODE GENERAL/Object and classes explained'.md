🚗 OOP EXPLAINED USING CARS
What is a Class?

    A class is a blueprint — like the idea of a car.

class Car {
    String color;
    int speed;

    void drive() {
        System.out.println("Car is driving");
    }
}

No real car exists yet. This is just a design.
What is an Object?

    An object is the actual car built from the blueprint.

Car myCar = new Car();  // Object created
myCar.color = "Red";
myCar.speed = 80;
myCar.drive();          // Outputs: Car is driving

Now this myCar has color, speed, and behavior — just like a real car.

You can make many cars (objects) from the same design (class).

✅ Now Let’s Push This Just a Bit Further

Let’s test your new understanding with a slightly bigger example.
🐶 Example: Class for a Dog

class Dog {
    String name;
    int age;

    void bark() {
        System.out.println(name + " says: Woof!");
    }
}

That’s the blueprint.

Now let’s make some dogs (objects):

public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Dog dog1 = new Dog();
        dog1.name = "Bruno";
        dog1.age = 3;
        dog1.bark();  // Output: Bruno says: Woof!

        Dog dog2 = new Dog();
        dog2.name = "Lucy";
        dog2.age = 2;
        dog2.bark();  // Output: Lucy says: Woof!
    }
}

So Now You Know:

    Dog → class (the plan)

    dog1, dog2 → objects (real dogs)

    name, age → properties (data)

    bark() → method (behavior)sssss
